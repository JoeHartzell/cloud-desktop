An [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop application for managing common cloud provider tasks. Designed to make navigating resources of a multi-cloud architecture easier.

## Background
Working with cloud providers can be tedious. Managing resources for AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc... is complex and often requires infrastructure as code solutions. The existing infrastructure as code solutions are great for creating resources, but not viewing them. Some tasks are easier when done through the UI of the cloud provider (or sometimes required). The motivation behind this project is straight forward; create a **simple** and **effecient**, desktop application that streamlines resource management for the major cloud providers. 

## Features
Below is a very _rough_ roadmap of ideas that will change often. This is a brand new project and priorities will change frequently.

### Cloud Providers
- [ ] AWS
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] GCP

### Cross Cloud Features
- [ ] Synchronized multi-window browsing
- [ ] Multiple login support (having multiple accounts "logged-in" at one time)
- [ ] SDK supported resource browsing
